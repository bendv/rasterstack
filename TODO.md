TODO
====

- add a spatial subset property to RasterTimeSeries
    - this will indicate that all stats, etc., are only computed on that spatial subset
- add a custom opening method to RasterTimeSeries
    - this will (e.g.) follow instructions related to pre-defined spatial subset (see above)
- add a custom temporal subsetting method to RasterTimeSeries (update metadata accordingly each time)
- add a method to apply a custom pixel-wise function to a RasterTimeSeries (including a compositing feature)
